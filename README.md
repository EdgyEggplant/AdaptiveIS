#AdaptiveIS.jl
Approximate the expected value of a function whose domain is the unit hypercube via adaptive importance sampling, where the importance sampling parameter is updated using robust stochastic approximation. Plotting of the sample paths of the empirical mean and importance sampling parameter is supported. See the documentation for more details.
